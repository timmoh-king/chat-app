## Using Node.js, GraphQL and React to build a real-time chat app

To build our new real-time chat application we'll be using [GraphQL](https://github.com/dotansimha/graphql-yoga), [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en), and most importantly [ReactHooks](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html). This app will offer users the ability to view all of the other online users once they have logged in, so they can chat with anyone on the platform. There will also be a feature to notify users when new members log in or if the person they're chatting with is actively typing a response. Sound like a good plan? Awesome, let's get going!
